![MovieHub Logo](link_to_logo_image)

MovieFusion is a Vue3-based web application that allows users to explore and discover movies, view trending films, access movie details, and create personalized collections. The app utilizes Vue3 for the front-end framework, Vuex for state management, Firebase for user authentication and user data storage, and TMDB API for fetching movie and cast details.

## Features

- **Trending Movies**: Get a glimpse of the latest and most popular movies directly on the homepage.

- **Genre-Based Filtering**: Browse movies based on genres of interest, providing a personalized movie discovery experience.

- **Detailed Movie Information**: Access comprehensive details about each movie, including cast information, release date, and more.

- **Cast Details**: Explore details about the cast of a movie, including their biographies and filmography.

- **Collections**: Users can create personalized collections to categorize and save movies based on their preferences.

- **Vue Toastify for Messages**: Utilize Vue Toastify to display success and error messages in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue3**: Front-end framework for building user interfaces.

- **Vuex**: State management library to manage application state in a centralized manner.

- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service for user authentication and data storage.

- **TMDB API**: The Movie Database API to fetch movie and cast details.

- **Vue Toastify**: Vue3-based library for displaying toast notifications.

## Getting Started

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a Firebase project and configure your Firebase credentials.
5. Set up the TMDB API key by registering on the TMDB website.
6. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Firebase and TMDB API credentials.

```env
